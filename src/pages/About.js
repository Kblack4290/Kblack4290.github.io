                        <p>What is going on, my name is Keith! I am originally from the Hudson Valley in New York but moved to
                        Denver, Colorado about 4 years ago with my fiancé. We never visited Colorado before but knew that we
                        wanted a change. We saved up some money selling antiques on eBay. Once we achieved our goal, we packed
                        up our car and drove 27 hours in 2 days to Denver!</p>

                        <p>My favorite things about Colorado is the weather, a good balance of City and outdoor life, going to
                        see professional sports, and being able to vote by mail. </p>

                        <p>With the support of my loved ones, I was able to start a career in Property Management. After a
                        year of employment, I was able to purchase my first home and begin setting roots. I am still working
                            as a Property Manager, but I have decided to take the opportunity to pursue a career change to Coding.</p>

                        <p>My fiancé saw that Denver University was offering a 6-month coding boot-camp. I decide to enroll in the
                        program, and it has been one of the better decisions I have made so far. My favorite aspects about
                        coding are the creativity, the challenge, and the satisfaction I receive when solving a problem or
                        completing a project. I am quickly realizing how much I am enjoying coding. I am
                            looking forward to putting my skill to use in a new career! Look at what I have accomplished so far!</p>
